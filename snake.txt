In Python, a for loop is 
usually written as a loop over an iterable object. This means you 
don’t need a counting variable to access
 items in the iterable. Sometimes, though, you do want to have a variable that changes on each loop iteration. Rather than creating and incrementing a variable yourself, 
you can use Python’s enumerate() to get a counter and the value from the iterable at the same time!
